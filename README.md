Some notes about the project.

Basics
  Its' built in React & Redux
  The styling has been done with Material-Ui, which is uses react components. It handles most of the styling which is why there isn't much CSS. Hopefully they is of a material design style is OK. For this reason I have not included Sass or another CSS preprocessor. If I was to I would have kept the ssame file structure and used webpack.
  I have added any tests to this project. It's something I only have basic experience with so added test would have only test the most obvious of things anyway.
